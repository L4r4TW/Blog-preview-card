## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Using the flexbox in css
- Media queries for mobile devices
- Using Figma to make the design more professional

### Continued development

In my next project I want to put more focus on the placement of the elements, because for me this is the hardest part in HTML and CSS. I also want to improve my responsive design skills.
